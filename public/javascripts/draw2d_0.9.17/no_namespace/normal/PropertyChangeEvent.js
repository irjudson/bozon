/**
 * @class
 * A "PropertyChange" event gets delivered whenever a model changes a property. A PropertyChangeEvent object is sent
 * as an argument to the PropertyChangeListener methods.
 * Normally PropertyChangeEvents are accompanied by the name and the old and new value of the changed property.
 * Null values may be provided for the old and the new values if their true values are not known.
 * An event source may send a null object as the "property" to indicate that an arbitrary set of if its properties
 * have changed. In this case the old and new values should also be null.
